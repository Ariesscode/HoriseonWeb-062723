# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Client request

```
As a website developer, 
I want to render a codebase structure that follows accessibility standards,
so that the site is optimized for all search engines using desktop view. 
```

## Final website description

```
Given a webpage which meets accessibility standards, when you view the source code
you will  find semantic HTML elements that are easy for users to define each element or section of the page.
When you view the structure of the HTML elements, then you will find that the elements follow a logical html structure independent of styling and positioning. When you view the icon and image elements, then you will see added altertanitve text, so that the site is accessible to all users. If image or icons are not responding in website, alternative text define the image for the client. When you view the heading attributes, then they fall in sequential order.
When you view the title element, then you find a concise, descriptive title. The key mission in this project was to not make any changes, but to clean up the format used in code in index.html and their style sheet, so that code is easily understandable to users that want to know what functions or elements were used in the making of the site. Lastly, making sure that each propety is working properly, such as buttons, links, and images. In the future, I would I would like to add a diplay property to each section, so that the site can fit the viewport of any device.
